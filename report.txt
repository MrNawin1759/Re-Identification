Soccer Player Tracking and Re-Identification System
Technical Report

1. Introduction
This system implements robust soccer player tracking with re-identification capabilities using:
- Custom YOLOv11 for detection
- DeepSORT for tracking
- Feature-based re-identification

2. Methodology
2.1 Detection Phase
- YOLOv11 model (best.pt) fine-tuned for soccer
- Processes 384×640 resolution frames
- Filters: confidence > 0.5, class = players

2.2 Tracking Pipeline
1. Frame input (720p @ 30fps)
2. Player detection (YOLOv11)
3. Feature extraction (ResNet18)
4. DeepSORT tracking
5. Re-ID matching
6. Output visualization
